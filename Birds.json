Ad. has diagnostic striped head and sides; some have a double breast band, as in Magellanic Penguin, but upper band is narrower in African Penguin and it lacks the narrow, white line around the base of the lower mandible. Juv. lacks bold patterning, with whitish underparts and upperparts varying from greyish blue to brown; some juvs moult part or all of their heads to ad. plumage before their first complete moult.  Voice: Loud, donkey-like braying at colonies, especially at night.  Status and biology: Endemic. ENDANGERED due to competition with pelagic fisheries, pollution, predation and disturbance at br. colonies. Regular within 20 km of shore; vagrant >50 km offshore. Population has fallen by half since 2004; currently 26 000 pairs breed at islands and a few coastal sites along the west and south coasts. Breeds year-round.",

Larger and longer necked than Western Cattle Egret, with a longer bill. In br. plumage, has long plumes on back and chest; bill and upper legs are red, and lores are lime-green. Voice: Typical, heron-like ''waaaark''. Status and biology: Common resident and nomad at marshes and flooded grassland; rarely at estuaries. Breeds colonially (up to 70 pairs) in reeds or trees, usually with other egrets, herons, cormorants and ibises.",

Distinguished from larger White-fronted Plover by the breast band and lack of a white, hindneck collar; appears more compact and shorter tailed. Imm. resembles female, but with narrower, more buffy breast band; no chestnut on sides of neck. Juv. lacks any black or chestnut coloration; breast band pale grey, often incomplete. Voice: A single ''prrp'' or ''tooit''. Status and biology: Near-threatened. Uncommon, localised resident and partial migrant found predominantly at saltpans in summer; some move to estuaries and coastal wetlands in winter, when several thousand present at Walvis Bay and Sandwich Harbour, Namibia. In the south of the range, most birds are confined to commercial saltpans. Regional population around 11 000 birds.",

Status and biology: Fairly common resident of forest floor and understorey; secretive and easily overlooked. Flushes to a low branch when disturbed, giving impression of a small, dark dove that lacks the pale, banded rump of Blue-spotted and Emerald-spotted Wood Doves.",

Overall coloration variable from buff-grey to silver-grey, depending on its origins in the Palearctic. In flight, male has white tips to outer tail and white outer primary window. Female has tail and wings all dark; appears greyer than female Pennant-winged Nightjar; tail more rounded. Voice: Churring song, similar to Rufous-cheeked Nightjar, but rarely sings in Africa; occasionally utters a nasal grunt on flushing. Status and biology: Locally common Palearctic-br. summer migrant in woodland, savanna and plantations. Usually roosts lengthwise on branches, less often on the ground.",

Shorter-tailed than Yellow-mantled Widowbird, with a yellow rump and lower back (not a yellow mantle). Non-br. male is heavily streaked buffy brown, but retains the bright yellow rump and shoulder. Female is more heavily streaked below than female Yellow-mantled Widowbird, with an olive-yellow (not brown-streaked) rump; appreciably larger and more streaked than other female bishops. Juv. has buff back and less streaking below. Bill size increases along a gradient from northeast to south-west. Voice: Displaying males give high-pitched ''zeet, zeet, zeet'' or buzzy ''zzzzzzzzt'' calls. Status and biology: Common resident in damp, grassy areas and heathlands.",
