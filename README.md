# BirdApp
A birding app developed in Java, This project was developed for my School Final IT practical assessment task

## Requirements 

Uses Netbeans GUI so requires Netbeans. Extra JAR Files are included in the project.
- Netbeans v8 or newer
- Java JDK 8 or newer

## Customization
All birds in the Database are birds found in South Africa, if you wish to change the birds all you need to do is change all the birds in the `Birds.Json` file and then update the Database with a admin account through the GUI. If you do this you'll also have to update the `Species.Json` file with the correct IDs.
